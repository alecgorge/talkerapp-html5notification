# HTML 5 Notification for Talker

A plugin for [talkerapp.com](http://talkerapp.com) that allows for HTML5 notifications on supported webkit browsers.

After you install the plugin, you have to type something in the message box and then allow notifications.

Notifications will only be shown when you have talker open, but it isn't the current tab.
